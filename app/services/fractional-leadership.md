## Six Touchstones of Our Approach

| Touchstone         | What It Means for You                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Integrate          | Deeply embedded partnership with your team, working side-by-side to understand context, culture, and goals. Collaboration is prioritized over distant advice. |
| Data-Driven        | Every recommendation and decision is backed by evidence, analytics, and real user feedback—not just opinions or trends.                                        |
| Ruthless Focus     | Relentless prioritization of what truly relieves user pain. Distractions, vanity features, and unnecessary complexity are eliminated at every stage.           |
| Adaptive           | Engagements are tailored to the unique strengths, weaknesses, and evolving needs of each team and market. Flexibility is built into every process.             |
| Transparent        | Clear, open communication at every step. Clients always know what is happening, why decisions are made, and what comes next.                                   |
| Outcome-Obsessed   | Success is measured by real-world impact: user traction, loyalty, and sustainable growth—not just deliverables or activity.                                    |

These touchstones guide every engagement, marketing message, and decision. They are the foundation of how RealHandy delivers value and builds trust with clients.

|                | Consultant                | Fractional (My Model)         | Full-Time Employee         |
|----------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Integration**| External, limited context | Embedded, part of the team    | Fully embedded            |
| **Commitment** | Short-term, project-based | Medium-term, outcome-focused  | Long-term, career-focused |
| **Approach**   | Advice, decks, frameworks | Hands-on, builds & implements | Builds & owns outcomes    |
| **Cost**       | High hourly/project rates | Retainer, cost-effective      | Salary + equity/benefits  |
| **Deliverables**| Reports, recommendations | Custom solutions, real change | Ongoing delivery          |
| **Org Impact** | Surface-level, generic    | Deep, tailored, transformative| Deep, tailored, evolving  |
| **Exit**       | Leaves after advice       | Hires/trains replacement      | May stay indefinitely     |
| **Best For**   | One-off expertise, audits | Startups needing leadership   | Scaling, mature orgs      |



The best startups are built by relentlessly focusing on solving real user pain points. The RealHandy approach is simple: find the pain, validate it, and build only what users actually need to stop hurting. Everything else is a distraction.

RealHandy partners with founders to:

- Identify and deeply understand the core problems users face
- Test and validate that these problems are real and worth solving
- Design services and products that directly address those pain points—nothing more, nothing less
- Iterate quickly, discarding anything that doesn’t move the needle for users

Great startups emerge not by chasing features or trends, but by building the minimum that truly relieves user pain. That’s where traction, loyalty, and growth come from.

Technical and product leadership are treated as a single, holistic discipline—never separated, always intertwined at every stage.
Work begins after initial validation, guiding teams through service design, iterative testing, and then building the right technology for the needs of the business and its users.
Services are provided exclusively to startups and scale-ups from initial validation through the end of Series B.
Corporate-scale or post-Series B work is not accepted.
Fundraising is not part of the engagement (unless RealHandy is a founder). If fundraising is needed, a founder is required—not a fractional leader.

## Engagement Model

- **Always starts as a retainer.** No equity-only arrangements. Milestone-based compensation may be added as appropriate.
- **Every engagement has a finish date.** The goal is to build, scale, and then hire and onboard a replacement.
- **Handoff is tailored.** The transition and onboarding process for the next technical leader is designed based on the team’s needs.
- **No one-size-fits-all.** Deliverables and focus areas are customized to the strengths and weaknesses of each founding team.

## Typical Impact Areas

- Technical architecture and decision-making
- Engineering team structure, hiring, and process
- Technical debt management and code quality
- Organizational design and scaling
- Leadership coaching for founders and new managers
- Culture, communication, and feedback systems

---


## Why Fractional?

- Deep, embedded technical leadership—outcome-focused, not just advice.
- RealHandy operates as part of the team, not as an outsider with a slide deck.
- The goal is to become obsolete by building a team and systems that thrive long after the engagement ends.

## Is This Right For You?

- Founders or executive teams at startups (pre-Series C) needing technical leadership but not ready for a full-time CTO.
- Teams seeking a partner to build, scale, and then help hire and onboard a permanent replacement.
- Organizations that value candor, pattern recognition, and hands-on leadership.
