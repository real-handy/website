## Service Design Principles

Our service design is guided by these core principles:

1. **Authentic Expertise**: No hype, just straight-talking guidance backed by decades of experience
2. **Relationship Depth**: Low emotional investment initially, deep commitment as trust develops
3. **Pattern Recognition Value**: Helping clients avoid costly mistakes by recognizing recurring patterns
4. **Scalable Wisdom**: Making hard-earned insights accessible beyond one-to-one relationships
5. **Servant Leadership**: Emphasizing that true leadership means serving, not commanding
