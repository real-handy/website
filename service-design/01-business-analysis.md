# RealHandy.tech Business Analysis

## Core Business Evolution

- **Journey**: Evolution from short-term consultant (meetings, recommendations, code reviews) to becoming an embedded fractional team member clients can rely on
- **Personal connection**: Not a "mercenary/gun fighter consultant" - develops genuine investment in products and teams
- **Experience span**: Pre-dotcom bust to present day (20+ years of experience)
- **Innovation history**: Built early versions of now-common platforms:
  - Early e-commerce platform similar to Shopify (1999)
  - First internet TV station before modern streaming
  - Many "firsts" that preceded well-known platforms
- **Technology cycles**: Has witnessed and adapted through multiple technology cycles, from pre-dotcom to cloud computing to AI transformation

## Client Profile
- Primarily early-stage startups through Series C
- Prefers not to work with post-Series C companies

## Unique Value Proposition
- **Historical perspective**: Has "seen it all" across multiple technology cycles
- **Pattern recognition**: Can identify recurring patterns in what appear to be "new" problems
- **Tech archeology**: Understanding of how current technologies evolved from earlier iterations
- **Continuity**: Combines decades of experience with current technical knowledge

## Key Observations

1. **Personal investment** seems to be a differentiating factor from typical fractional CTOs who may maintain more professional distance
2. **Longevity** in the industry provides pattern recognition that's invaluable to startups facing seemingly "new" challenges
3. **Pre-fame innovation** experience gives perspective on what makes ideas succeed or fail commercially

## Questions for Further Exploration

1. How might we position the "been there before" experience as a key differentiator without sounding dismissive of current innovation?
2. How can we leverage the personal connection aspect as a selling point without making it seem like a business liability?
3. What specific patterns or cycles has RealHandy observed that would be most valuable to highlight for potential clients?
4. How does the preference for pre-Series C companies inform the service design and offerings?
